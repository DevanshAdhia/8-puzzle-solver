8-Puzzle Solver with GUI
A Python-based 8-Puzzle Solver with a graphical interface built using Tkinter. This project allows users to input any initial and goal states for the classic 8-puzzle and visually see the solution step by step using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Interactive and intuitive interface to input puzzle states and visualize the solution.
Custom Input: Enter any valid initial and goal state for the puzzle.
Automated Solver: Uses BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state.
Solution Animation: Step-by-step animation of the puzzle solving process.
Result Metrics: Displays runtime, nodes expanded, search depth, and path cost.
Input Validation: Checks for valid states and solvability before attempting to solve.
How It Works
User enters the initial state and goal state of the 8-puzzle.
The program checks if the puzzle is valid and solvable.
BFS is used to explore possible moves and find the solution path.
The puzzle solution is animated tile by tile on the GUI.
Performance metrics are displayed alongside the solution
